# audioClustering

This is some research I'm doing where I cut audio files in N chunks and put the raw data in a numpy matrix, then I reduce the dimensionality using Component Analysis and then I use Hierarchy Clustering and try different distance functions and explore how is the algorithm dividing and if it can be use for musical composition.

Also trying out FFT instead of raw audio data (or both)

## Libraries

I'm using the following python libs

* scipy
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib

## Observations

This is a personal project, it is not very tidy or fancy but it has quite a lot comments in the code to understand whats going on.
